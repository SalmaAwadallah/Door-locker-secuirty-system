# Door-locker-secuirty-system
The project was developed using ATmega16 microcontrollers. It consists of two ECU’s. The first ECU called “HMI” responsible for interfacing with the user and the second ECU called “control-ECU” which is responsible for the system operations and control. In this  project I implemented the following drivers: Keypad, LCD, DC Motor, UART, Timer, I2C and External EEPROM.
